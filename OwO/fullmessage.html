            Hiii, I like to start this by saying that I do enjoy talking to you. 
            Your soft voice, the way you react, and how I find it easy to talk to you. 
            I find your whole personality endearing and enthralling, which is pretty much why I started talking to you... 
            Honestly, I thought you'll find it annoying that I suddenly started talking to you everyday. 
            But I guess it wouldn't hurt to try, right? Well now I'm here laying out how I feel. 
        </p>

        <p class="second">
            I want to get to know your whole self, from what color you want to what you think of things. 
            I like you, not only platonically... It kinda started feeling this way mid november, 
            I wasn't really expecting a message from you that time, then you asked how was our filming. 
            It sounds cheesy and cliche but hey can't a guy be delusional. ToT 
        </p>

        <p class="third">After that day, I couldn't help but think how are you, 
            then a week after that I started talking to you daily in hopes to have a connection with you.  
        </p>
