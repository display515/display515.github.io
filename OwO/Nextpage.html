            So now I'm here telling you how I really feel, honestly by how many times I tried to imply it indirectly, 
            I guess that was on me kinda like a mixed signal tbh, 
            but that's because I'm too scared to see what your reaction will be. 
            What I'm saying rn is that this is how I genuinely feel about you, no hidden meanings or second thought. 
            I want to be open and be sincere towards you. 
        </p>
        <footer>Sincerely, Glance</footer>
